# 242-Project_Movie-Recommendation-System

4-movie cast crew:
  1. Python code converting json files(credits) into csv files, and then we extract the cast and crew informations to create corresponding cast and crew csv files;
  2. R code to preprocess the cast and crew dataset. For example, we only extract three actors and 1 directors per movie, and then according to the frequency, we extract top 50 directors and top 150 actors
